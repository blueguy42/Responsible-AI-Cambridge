# Responsible-AI-Cambridge

A small repository for coursework and research in the Responsible AI module of the Cambridge MPhil Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence program. It contains notebooks, figures, and environment configuration used throughout the term.

## Structure

- `notebook.ipynb` – primary Jupyter notebook with analysis.
- `notebook.html` – rendered version of the notebook.
- `figures/` – generated plots and other visuals.
- `environment.yml` – Conda environment specification for reproducibility.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate responsible-ai-cambridge
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook and open `notebook.ipynb`.

## Notes

Work in this repo is for academic purposes only. See the notebook for detailed analysis and methodology.
